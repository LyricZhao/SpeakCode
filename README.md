#### How to use

- The **Open/Save** Button is for file management.
- Press the **Speak** Button, you can say something (only a few words can be recognized, later it will be told)
- You can change the special words you want to speak using the **Settings** menu.
  - For example, you want to input "iostream" in your code, you must first change the settings by setting the String 1 to "iostream".
  - Later, you can input "iostream" by speaking "string one".
- The words can be recognized (Sorry for its low recognition rate, I spent a lot of time to tune, but ...):

#### Workload

- About **1.5k** LoC.
- The most difficult part is linking the CMUSphinux to my QT program.
- And I have no experience on QT, I spent a little time to learn it, it also needs my effort.
- What's more, I also spent time on compiling and packing my program into an App which can run on all the macOS devices.

#### Enjoy it!
